# About 

## Geolocation Web App

Geolocation is a lightweight web application that uses the browser’s Geolocation API to access the user’s location in real time. The app displays location-related data such as movement-based direction and speed (when supported by the device) and updates dynamically as the user moves. It runs entirely in the browser and does not require any backend or external libraries.

## Features
- Accesses the user’s current location using the Geolocation API
- Real-time location updates with watchPosition
- Displays movement-based direction and speed (device-dependent)
- Handles permission requests gracefully
- Simple and responsive user interface
- Fully browser-based with no backend required
